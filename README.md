This is school project for user interface class. During the semester, our group worked on an extensive project that encompassed crucial elements of UI/UX design and implementation. This project involved selecting a startup client and creating a new user interface for one of their products. This project was divided into several deliverables spread across the semester, including user research, design artifacts, prototyping, implementation, and user evaluation.

In addition, we participated in design critique sessions to review and provide feedback on design concepts produced for the project. At the end of the 2023 Spring semester, we presented our interactive prototypes and interface demo for the final project in a public showcase.
